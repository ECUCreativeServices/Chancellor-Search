<h2>Governance</h2>
East Carolina University is one of 17 institutions constituting the University of North Carolina System. This multi-campus university system is dedicated to serving the state of North Carolina and its people through world-class teaching, research and scholarship, and outreach and service. More than 239,000 students are enrolled in the UNC System’s 16 universities across the state and the N.C. School of Science and Mathematics, the country’s first public, residential high school for gifted students.

As ECU is part of the University of North Carolina System, the chancellor reports to the UNC System president and is responsible for carrying out the policies of the East Carolina University Board of Trustees and the UNC System Board of Governors. The system president reports to the UNC Board of Governors, whose members are elected by the North Carolina General Assembly.

<h2>Opportunities for Success</h2>
<h3>Sustain Access and Affordability</h3>
Anchored by a history of access, ECU remains committed to providing opportunities for an affordable education to rural and low-income students. To sustain ECU’s traditions of access and affordability, the next chancellor of ECU must be committed to maintaining a low-as-practical cost of attendance, prioritizing need-based aid opportunities for the most marginalized students.
<h3>Elevate Reputation and Brand</h3>
In the increasingly competitive world of higher education, the next chancellor must elevate the ECU brand to attract a diverse body of prospective students. From its start as a small teaching college, ECU has grown to a large research campus with a vibrant culture and traditions, upon which the next chancellor must capitalize in order to position the institution regionally and nationally. It is imperative that the next chancellor work with university and community leaders to strengthen the university’s reputation as a place of excellence.
<h3>Lead Efforts for Financial Sustainability</h3>
ECU’s ability to thrive and grow will require a fiscally sustainable budget and plan for maximizing the university’s core strengths and its commitment to providing a high-quality education to students. A medical school with a faculty practice plan, a large research enterprise and Division I athletics are some of the university’s unique assets to be leveraged for continued success. The long-term financial model for ECU will need to include increases in fundraising, research, strategic enrollment, and public and private partnerships. The next chancellor will lead these efforts.
<h3>Drive Regional Economic Development</h3>
The economy of eastern North Carolina is tied to the success of ECU. With ECU’s $1.7 billion overall economic impact on eastern North Carolina, the region depends on ECU for innovation and talent. Community engagement will be an essential role for the new chancellor to make Greenville a destination for business, health care, advanced manufacturing and entrepreneurship. The next chancellor will work with private businesses, local governments and community organizations to drive economic growth and generate regional transformation.

<div class="col-lg-6 col-xl-7">
<h3>Advance Health Care Education and Leadership</h3>
With a top-ranked health care enterprise, ECU is committed to advancing health equity in eastern North Carolina. Opportunities lie in the creation of a new School of Rural Public Health and a strengthened partnership with ECU’s affiliated teaching hospital, Vidant Medical Center. The Division of Health Sciences and the university-affiliated faculty practice plan, ECU Physicians, will require skilled oversight. The continued growth of the health care sector demands a strong leader familiar with the complexities of providing health care services and education in one of the most under-resourced communities in the state.

<h3>Recruit and Retain Talent</h3>
The next chancellor will have an opportunity to develop a strong leadership team. A demonstrated commitment to recruiting a diverse, high-quality faculty and staff is crucial to ensuring institutional stability. This requires the next chancellor to ensure that there are strong incentives and resources, including a focus on competitive salaries, benefits and professional development opportunities.
<h3>Transform Enrollment Strategy</h3>
Shifting national demographics will require a renewed leadership focus on enrollment strategy across all markets of traditional and nontraditional students as well as residential and online delivery platforms. The next chancellor must prioritize the university’s commitment to data-informed decision-making to better prepare for ECU’s future.
<h3>Foster University Governance</h3>
The next chancellor of ECU must utilize the strengths of shared governance to advance the university’s mission. This includes fostering relationships with the students, faculty, staff, alumni, Board of Trustees, the Board of Governors and the North Carolina General Assembly. This will require an advocate leader with strong communication skills who is able to connect with all constituencies.
<h2>Desired Qualifications &amp; Qualities</h2>
The Board of Trustees and campus community of East Carolina University seek a servant leader to advance the institution for the 21st century and beyond who is committed to ECU’s mission of student success, public service and regional transformation. We seek a leader who will embody ECU’s motto, <em>Servire</em>: “To Serve.” Earned terminal degree or equivalent leadership experience required. Candidates must have a record of successful executive leadership in complex organizations and a demonstrated commitment to higher education, diversity and inclusion, and excellence.
