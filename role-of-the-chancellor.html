<h1>The Role of the Chancellor</h1>
<h2>Governance</h2>
East Carolina University is one of 17 institutions composing the University of North Carolina System. This multi-campus university system is dedicated to serving the state of North Carolina and its people through world-class teaching, research and scholarship, and outreach and service. More than 239,000 students are enrolled in the UNC System’s 16 universities across the state and the N.C. School of Science and Mathematics, the country’s first public, residential high school for gifted students.

As part of the University of North Carolina System, the chancellor reports to the UNC System president and is responsible for carrying out the policies of the East Carolina University Board of Trustees and the UNC System Board of Governors. The system president reports to the UNC Board of Governors, whose members are elected by the North Carolina General Assembly.
<h2>Opportunities for Success</h2>
<h3>Access and Affordability</h3>
ECU’s commitment to an affordable education is paramount. Anchored by a history of access and opening the door to higher education for rural and low-income students and their families, ECU now serves the entire state of North Carolina and beyond. The chancellor must be committed to keeping the total cost of attendance as low as possible while prioritizing need-based aid opportunities for the most marginalized students, offering them opportunities to succeed at an university with nationally ranked programs, a growing research portfolio and a commitment to academic excellence.
<h3>Reputation and Brand</h3>
In the increasingly competitive world of higher education, the chancellor must elevate the ECU brand to attract a diverse group of prospective students. ECU has a vibrant culture and traditions. The next chancellor must understand the positioning of ECU in the local and national setting and work with university leaders to strengthen the university’s reputation as a place of excellence.
<h3>Financial Sustainability</h3>
ECU’s ability to thrive and grow will require a fiscally sustainable budget and plan for maximizing its core strengths and its commitment to providing a quality education to students. A medical school and faculty practice plan, a large research enterprise, and Division I athletics are some of the university’s unique opportunities for continued success. The long-term financial model will need to include increases in fundraising, research, strategic enrollment, and public and private partnerships.
<h3>Regional Economic Development</h3>
The economy of eastern North Carolina is tied to the success of ECU. The next chancellor will work with private businesses, local governments, the military and community organizations to drive economic growth and empower regional transformation. With a $1.7 billion overall economic impact on eastern North Carolina, the region depends on ECU for innovation and talent. Community engagement will be an essential role for the new chancellor to make Greenville a destination for business, health care, advanced manufacturing and entrepreneurship.
<h3>Health Care Education and Leadership</h3>
With a top-ranked health care enterprise, ECU is committed to advancing health equity in eastern North Carolina. Opportunities lie in the creation of a new School of Rural Public Health and a strengthened partnership with ECU’s affiliated teaching hospital, Vidant Medical Center. The Division of Health Sciences and the university-affiliated faculty practice plan, ECU Physicians, will require skilled oversight. The continued growth of the health care sector demands a strong leader familiar with the complexities of providing health care services and education in one of the most under-resourced communities in the state.
<h3>Recruit and Retain Talent</h3>
The next chancellor will have an opportunity to develop a strong leadership team. A demonstrated commitment to recruiting a diverse, high-quality faculty and staff is crucial to ensuring stability and longevity for the university. The chancellor must also ensure that there are strong initiatives and resources to retain top-tier faculty and staff. This will include a focus on providing competitive salaries, benefits and professional development opportunities to promote an environment of inclusion and excellence.
<h3>Enrollment Strategy</h3>
Shifting national demographics will require a focus on enrollment strategy across all markets of traditional and nontraditional students as well as residential and online delivery platforms. The next chancellor will have to prioritize the university’s resources to be better aligned with those changing demographics using data-informed decision making to better prepare for ECU’s future.
<h3>University Governance</h3>
The chancellor must utilize the strengths of shared governance to advance the mission of ECU. This includes fostering relationships with the students, faculty, staff, Board of Trustees, UNC Board of Governors and North Carolina General Assembly. This will require an advocate with strong communication skills who is able to connect with all constituencies.
