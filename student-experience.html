<h1><a href="https://admissions.ecu.edu/explore/student-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Student Experience Website">Student Experience</a></h1>
The faculty and staff of ECU are fully committed to provide our students the best experiences — academically, socially, culturally and experientially. The results of this commitment are proven by the successes realized post-graduation. Embracing student diversity by first-generation status, rural heritage, race, ethnicity, religion, LGBTQ identity and more, ECU provides a host of academic and student support services to develop and meet the needs of the whole student. Project YOU@ECU is a new initiative designed to promote student personal agency toward academic, career and personal success.
