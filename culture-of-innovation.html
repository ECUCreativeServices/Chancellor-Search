<h1>Culture of Innovation</h1>
At ECU, innovation fuels vision. As Pirates and pioneers, ECU faculty and students develop solutions that matter here in the east, statewide and beyond.

The only named school of entrepreneurship in North Carolina, the <a href="https://business.ecu.edu/msoe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miller School of Entrepreneurship</a> serves as a regional hub partnering with key strategic partners to offer co-curricular programs that help serve as a catalyst for regional transformation.

The <a href="https://business.ecu.edu/msoe/pec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pirate Entrepreneurship Challenge</a> is a business pitch competition that now awards $100,000 in cash and prizes to students.

ECU’s student entrepreneurship program, <a href="https://news.ecu.edu/2019/02/19/funding-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RISE29</a>, was honored by the United States Association for Small Business and Entrepreneurship with its award for <a href="https://news.ecu.edu/2020/01/08/simply-the-best/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Excellence in Co-Curricular Innovation</a>. (January 2020)

The <a href="https://rede.ecu.edu/innovation/innovation-incubation-and-millennial-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">East Carolina Research and Innovation Campus</a> was conceived to connect the talents of university researchers with partners in industry, government, military and business to discover innovations that boost rural and coastal prosperity.

Funded by the National Science Foundation, <a href="https://icorps.ecu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Innovation Corps@ECU (I-Corps)</a> embraces the formation of ideas, innovation and commercialization of inventions. ECU is one of only two schools in the state with this five-year funding.

<a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greenville SEED@ECU</a> is a partnership among the city of Greenville, ECU and the Greenville-Pitt County Chamber of Commerce. Flexible collaborative space and support are provided to qualified entrepreneurs and start-up companies.

In 2008 and 2015, ECU was recognized with the <a href="https://rede.ecu.edu/engagement/programs-and-initiatives/carnegie-community-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnegie Foundation’s Classification for Community Engagement</a>. ECU is also designated as an Innovation and Economic Prosperity University by the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. The campus is one of only 44 in the nation to hold both designations.
<h2><a href="https://rede.ecu.edu/2019-end-of-year-research-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a></h2>
Growing the research and creative activity enterprises at East Carolina remains one of our top priorities. ECU celebrates 2018–19 as the most productive — and by many measures, the most successful — year regarding research, innovation and creative activities in our institution’s history.

<h2><a href="https://rede.ecu.edu/research-centers-institutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centers and Institutes</a></h2>
ECU’s centers, institutes, college and department centers, research service centers, and field sites strengthen and enrich the university’s missions of research, service and instruction. ECU has 13 units, approximately half that have a primary mission of research and half with a primary mission of service that transcend the traditional boundaries of academic departments, bringing experts together across disciplines to address complex issues and partner with government and industry leaders.
