<p>Dear Fellow Pirates,</p>

<p>As we begin the journey of selecting a new chancellor to lead East Carolina University into the future, I want to first thank the Pirate Nation – students, faculty, staff, alumni and supporters – for your time, energy and resources during this exciting time. East Carolina University has served the people of our great state for 112 years. Now we have a tremendous opportunity as we search for the 12th chancellor to lead this outstanding institution.</p>

<p>Across the United States, higher education is undergoing dynamic change. Our next chancellor will be challenged to work with all constituencies while implementing a sustainable vision for East Carolina’s commitments to student success, public service and regional transformation. In recent decades, ECU has cemented its place among the state’s leading educational institutions. We added a School of Dental Medicine, an engineering program, and an Honors College, grew our student body significantly and became a member of a competitive athletic conference, the American.</p>

<p>It’s foundational that our chancellor must be focused on student success and continue to recruit excellent faculty and researchers. Our next chancellor must continue the momentum to drive the university pillars – the Millennial Campus, growing research, philanthropy, the successful partnership with Vidant Health System, rural health care transformation, regional transformation and alignment of legislative priorities.</p>

<p>East Carolina University’s accomplishments have been transformative, and we have before us the opportunity to write the next chapter in the university’s history. Our university is much too important not to be successful in this endeavor.</p>

<p>Throughout the search process we will use this website to keep the Pirate Nation and the public informed. Constituent forums are part of the search process, so please monitor announcements for more information. I look forward with excitement to our work together.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Vern Davenport<br>
Chair, ECU Board of Trustees</p>
